# ProgrammingLanguageProject


**This repository contains my work/projects for the semester-long programming language project that is a part of course CS330 - Structure and Organization of Programming Language at Simmons University for the spring 2024 semester.**

The language I will be learning through this project is JavaScript. The project includes homework assignments and eventually a large-scale final project.

As the purpose of this project is learning, I welcome and appreciate feedback and advice.
